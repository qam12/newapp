#   News App

**Live Demo**: [https://newapp-sable.vercel.app/](https://newapp-sable.vercel.app/)



##  Project Overview

This is a multi-source news app built with **React.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Redux Toolkit**, providing a rich and responsive reading experience. It pulls live articles from popular news providers like **NewsAPI**, **The Guardian**, and **New York Times**, unifying them into a single, personalized feed.


##  Design & Experience

- **Inspired by Flipboard**: Clean, magazine-style layout for intuitive reading.
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Fully responsive and smooth on all screen sizes.
- **Minimal & Functional UI**: Emphasis on category transitions, animations, and accessibility.


##  Architecture & Development Patterns

- **Container / Presentational Split**: Maintains separation of logic and UI.
- **Service Layer**: All API logic is abstracted into dedicated clients.
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic through custom hooks.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Scalable state with slices and async thunks.
- **Performance Optimizations**: `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` used to prevent unnecessary renders.
- **Modular Codebase**: Structured into clear domains: `components`, `hooks`, `store`, `api`.


##  Navigation & Personalization

###  Categories

- Navigate across: **Business**, **Science**, **Health**, **News**, **Sports**, **Tech**, **Entertainment**, **My Feed**.
- Active category is stored in Redux and implements filter cache across navigation.
- Smooth transitions enhance experience on both web and mobile.

###  Filters

- Filter by **source**, **category**, and **author** using the filter drawer and personalized feed.
- Choose from **NewsAPI**, **Guardian**, and **NYT**.

###  Custom Feeds

- Multi-source selection lets users create a unified stream.
- Author/category filtering for deeper personalization.
- Smart deduplication removes duplicate stories across sources.



##  Search Functionality

- Debounced input using a custom search hook to minimize API load.
- Live results display as you type.



##  Article Display

###  Article List Features

- Articles show: **title**, **image**, **author**, **source**, **publish time**.
- Fully responsive list layout with smooth scroll and optimized render performance.

###  Animated Loading

- Skeleton components maintain layout structure while loading.
- Ensures smooth transitions between loading and data-ready states.



##  API Integrations

- **Sources**: NewsAPI, The Guardian, NYT.
- Articles are **normalized into a single type** for unified handling.
- Handles **strict rate limits**, especially from NYT.
- Graceful error handling with clear fallback UIs.



##  Load More Pagination

- Pagination is synced with source API responses.
- Loading indicators show progress on the "Load More" button.
- Handles API rate limits and displays fallback messages when limits are reached.


##  Pending Tasks (Left Due to Time Constraints)

- [ ] Add support for **favorite articles**
- [ ] Enable **search history**
- [ ] Add **unit & integration tests**
- [ ] Implement **API response caching**
- [ ] Add **fallback UI** for edge cases


##  Environment Variables

```
REACT_APP_GUARDIAN_API_KEY=your_guardian_api_key  
REACT_APP_NYT_API_KEY=your_nyt_api_key  
REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
```

In the project root, create a `.env` file with the following content:

### Environment Troubleshooting

If you're facing issues running the app, here are some common checks:

1. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - Ensure the `.env` file is placed in the **project root directory**.
   - Make sure there are **no spaces around the `=`** sign.
   - Do **not add quotes** around the API keys.
   - Restart the development server after making changes to the `.env` file.

2. **.env File Not Being Picked Up**
   - Verify that the file is named **exactly** `.env` (no extensions or typos).
   - Check that you're not committing it accidentally â€” it should be listed in `.gitignore`.

3. **Build Fails or API Key Errors**
   - Double-check that all required keys (`REACT_APP_*`) are present in `.env`.
   - Ensure your API keys are **active and not expired**.
   - Make sure you're using the correct prefix: `REACT_APP_` is required for React to expose them.

4. **Still Not Working?**
   - Try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then reinstall dependencies:
     ```bash
     rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
     npm install
     ```

5. **Check Console Logs**
   - Open your browser's dev tools (F12) and check for any relevant error messages in the **Console** or **Network** tabs.

##  Docker Setup

###  Prerequisites

- Ensure **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** is installed and running:
  - [Download for macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
  - [Download for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

### ðŸ”¨ Build & Run the Docker Container

```
docker-compose up --build
```

###  Docker Troubleshooting

If you're having issues running the app with Docker, here are some common solutions:

### 1. Docker Daemon Not Running
Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running before executing Docker commands.

- On Windows/macOS: Open Docker Desktop and wait for it to initialize.
- On Linux: Run `sudo systemctl start docker` if it's not running.

### 2. Port Already in Use
You may see an error like:

- This means the specified port (e.g., `3000`) is already in use.
- Solution: Stop the conflicting service or change the port in `docker-compose.yml`.

### 3. .env File Not Loaded
If environment variables aren't being picked up:

- Make sure your `.env` file is in the **project root**.
- Ensure variable names start with `REACT_APP_` for React apps.
- Rebuild the container:
  ```
  docker-compose down
  docker-compose up --build
  ```
